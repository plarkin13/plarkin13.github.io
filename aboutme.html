									<h2>My Professional Experience</h2>
									<p>Over the last 5 years of my career, I worked at a consulting company providing direction and aid to the top tier universities in the country in their pursuit of clinical and non-clinical research endeavors. As a higher education and research consultant, the components of each project are a mixture on par with a Cobb salad. There’s interviewing offices of people, analyzing their systems’ data and processes, managing project teams, presenting recommendations to executives, etc. I built and honed a variety of skills to be successful in that field.
                                        </p>
									<hr />
									<p> I'm currently upskilling and building up my analytical toolbox through the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly. I built a skill set to utilize Python for data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning modeling.
                                            Additional tools learned in the course include: include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, AWS, web scraping, git, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Spark. I continue to pursue passion projects and learn more about the dense field of Data Science.
                                            
                                            </p>
